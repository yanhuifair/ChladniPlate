Real-time, audio-driven Chladni-figure particle visualizer. Sand particles slide
along the gradient of a Chladni standing-wave field and settle on the nodal
lines, while the figure **morphs continuously with whatever you are playing**.

## Highlights

- **System-output listening (recommended)** — Click `OUTPUT`: the figure follows
  music played by *any* app in real time. When a virtual loopback device is
  detected it is captured **directly** (no popup, auto-restores after refresh);
  otherwise the app falls back to screen-share capture (pick **Entire Screen**
  and tick **Also share system audio**). Adaptive gain normalizes the external
  playback level and a beat detector makes the plate and sand pulse with the drums.
- **System-input listening** — Click `INPUT` to use the microphone or any other
  input device, switchable via the **INPUT DEVICE** selector.
- **MIDI input** — Click `MIDI` to drive the figure from any MIDI keyboard or
  controller in real time; the played note sets the mode/frequency live.
- **Simulation** — Click `SIMULATION` to sweep a synthetic frequency with the
  slider; the app also **emits a matching sine tone** so you can hear the
  frequency you are dialing in.
- **Continuous morphing** — Instead of snapping between discrete modes, the
  `(m, n)` parameters ease smoothly toward spectrum-derived targets every frame.
- **GPU-accelerated particles** — On supporting browsers the entire particle
  simulation (physics + collision + instanced rendering) runs on the GPU via
  WebGPU; otherwise it falls back to a Web Worker + WebGL2 path, and finally to
  a same-thread WebGL2 + CPU path — so even 100 000 grains stay smooth.
- **Save as PNG** — The top-right **SAVE IMAGE** button composites the plate
  texture and the WebGL particle layer into a single PNG and downloads it.
- **Multi-language** — The UI follows your browser language automatically
  (currently English / 中文).
- **Monochrome geek aesthetic** — Pure black plate, white nodal lines, white
  particles, fixed-position HUD.

                      analysis + beat detection
  chladni.js          pure math: ψ(u,v,m,n), gradient, freq→mode
  field-grid.js       coarse field-grid cache shared by CPU physics & render
  particle-records.js sand-grain render-record batching (zero-allocation)
  particles.js        height-map particle physics (CPU path)
  particles-worker.js off-thread physics + WebGL2 drawing (fallback accelerator)

  i18n.js             locale detection + en/zh dictionaries
```

## Rendering pipeline

The particle layer picks the best available backend at startup, in this order:

1. **WebGPU (preferred)** — `webgpu-particles.js` runs the whole simulation on the
   GPU: a compute pass for per-particle physics, a compute pass for spatial-grid
   collision (atomic counters + neighbor de-overlap, so grains never overlap and
   pile into bands of finite width along the nodal lines), and an instanced
   render pass for the sand. Requires `navigator.gpu`.
2. **Web Worker + WebGL2 (fallback accelerator)** — if WebGPU is unavailable, the
   JS physics and WebGL2 sand drawing move into `particles-worker.js`
   (OffscreenCanvas), keeping the main thread free for audio analysis and UI.
3. **Same-thread WebGL2 + CPU (final fallback)** — if Workers/OffscreenCanvas are
   unavailable, `render-gl.js` draws the sand on the main thread with CPU physics
   from `particles.js`.

The plate and its nodal lines are drawn by `render-plate-gl.js` (WebGL2 on
`#platecanvas`); if WebGL2 is missing it falls back to a Canvas2D nodal texture.

## Run

ES modules require an HTTP server (not `file://`):

```bash
cd /Users/Fair/Desktop/ChladniPlate
python3 -m http.server 8765
# open http://localhost:8765/index.html
```

or, using the bundled script:

```bash
npm start
```

> Microphone / screen-share / MIDI permissions require a **real browser tab**
> (Chrome or Edge). The in-app preview panel and `file://` open cannot request
> those permissions.

## Controls

- **AUDIO SOURCE**: INPUT / OUTPUT / SIMULATION / MIDI.
- **SHARE** (to the right of OUTPUT): pop the system-audio share request
  (screen share) directly, skipping the virtual-loopback path — handy when no
  loopback device is installed or you want to grant screen-share audio
  explicitly.
- **SIMULATION SOUND**: toggle whether SIMULATION and MIDI emit a matching sine
  tone (so you can hear the dialed-in frequency). On by default.
- **SIMULATION**: the slider sweeps a synthetic frequency; with SIMULATION SOUND
  on it also emits a matching sine tone, and the figure follows it live.
- **MIDI**: the played note drives the mode and frequency in real time, and (with
  the sound toggle on) emits that note's tone.
- **VOL BOOST**: post-gain on the analyzed level (0.1×–10×) to normalize quiet
  or loud sources.
- **PATTERN / PARTICLES / COLLISION**: toggle the guide texture, the sand, and
  the inter-grain collision separately. COLLISION enables short-range repulsion
  so grains cannot overlap and pile into bands of finite width along the nodal
  lines.
- **PLATE SHAPE**: SQUARE / CIRCLE / TRIANGLE / HEXAGON — switches the plate
  outline and its modal field (square & circle follow physical eigenmode models;
  triangle & hexagon are Dₙ-symmetric art approximations).
- **SIGN** (square only): switches between the two degenerate (m,n)/(n,m)
  superpositions — minus (classic X-shaped nodal diagonal) and plus (cross +
  corner arcs); both are physically realizable patterns.
- **SAND GRAINS**: number of particles (100–100 000).
- **SAND GRAIN**: grain diameter in mm (visual size).
- **STIFFNESS**: plate stiffness coefficient (relative to 1.0; ∝ √E).
- **PLATE SIDE**: plate side length in cm (visual scale).
- **FULLSCREEN**: hide all UI and fill the window with the plate (press `F` to
  enter, `ESC` to exit).
- **SAVE IMAGE**: download the current view as a PNG (press `S` anywhere).
- **MODE** (top-right readout): shows the current pattern `m×n`.
- The figure always follows the spectrum/frequency in real time (AUTO); manual
  mode selection has been removed.

## Notes

- Preferences (source, frequency, toggles, language) persist in `localStorage`.
- For `INPUT`/`OUTPUT` the audio is analyzed but not played back (no feedback
  loop). `SIMULATION` and `MIDI` emit a sine tone (toggled by SIMULATION SOUND);
  the figure still morphs with the analyzed spectrum regardless of this toggle.
- `OUTPUT` auto-restores after a refresh when using loopback capture; the
  screen-share fallback requires a user gesture, so in that case the app falls
  back to `SIMULATION` (click `OUTPUT` again to resume listening).
- Physics uses the free square-plate Chladni equation; no artificial
  center-node constraint is imposed, so the plate center may show an antinode.

## macOS system-audio capture tips

- **Virtual loopback capture (OUTPUT's preferred path, no popup)**: `OUTPUT`
  auto-detects and uses virtual loopback devices (BlackHole / LarkAudioDevice /
  Squirrels Audio, etc.), switchable via the **OUTPUT DEVICE** selector. Create
  a Multi-Output Device (speakers + the virtual device) in Audio MIDI Setup and
  route system output to it so you can still hear the sound. The selection
  persists across reloads.
- **Screen-share fallback**: with no loopback device, `OUTPUT` uses screen
  share — on Chrome / Edge (macOS 13+) share **Entire Screen** and tick
  "Also share system audio" to hear every app; otherwise share a **tab** with
  "Share tab audio" (only that tab is heard).
- No virtual device? Install [BlackHole](https://existential.audio/blackhole/).
- If sharing succeeds without audio, a toast asks you to retry with the audio
  checkbox; pressing the browser's "Stop sharing" switches back to `SIMULATION`.
